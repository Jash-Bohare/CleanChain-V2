# CleanChain 🌱
**Earn ECO tokens for verified waste cleanups - Transparent, on-chain environmental impact tracking**

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Environmental Crisis
- **Global waste pollution** is reaching critical levels, with over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste generated annually
- **Lack of incentives** for individuals to participate in cleanup activities
- **No transparent verification** system for environmental impact tracking
- **Limited community engagement** in environmental conservation efforts

### Why This Matters
- **Immediate impact**: Every cleanup directly improves local environments
- **Scalable solution**: Blockchain technology enables global participation
- **Economic incentives**: Token rewards encourage sustainable behavior
- **Community building**: Creates a network of environmental stewards

## 💡 Solution / What It Does

CleanChain is a decentralized platform that incentivizes environmental cleanup through blockchain-based verification and token rewards. Users can claim cleanup locations, submit photographic proof of their work, and earn ECO tokens upon community verification. The platform combines GPS tracking, photo verification, and community voting to create a transparent, gamified environmental impact system.

### Core Workflow:
1. **Discover** → Users find nearby cleanup locations on an interactive map
2. **Claim** → Reserve a location within 15km radius
3. **Clean** → Perform the cleanup and document with before/after photos
4. **Verify** → Community votes on the quality and completion of work
5. **Reward** → Earn ECO tokens for verified cleanups

## 🔄 Simple User Flow

```
Connect Wallet → Complete Profile → Browse Map → Claim Location → 
Upload Photos → Community Votes → Earn Tokens → Track Impact
```

### Detailed User Journey:

1. **Onboarding**
   - Connect MetaMask wallet
   - Complete profile with email and username
   - Navigate to interactive map

2. **Location Discovery**
   - View cleanup locations on map
   - Check distance (must be within 15km)
   - Review location details and potential rewards

3. **Cleanup Process**
   - Claim a location (becomes unavailable to others)
   - Perform the cleanup
   - Upload before/after photos as proof

4. **Verification & Rewards**
   - Community members vote on cleanup quality
   - Successful verifications earn ECO tokens
   - Track environmental impact in dashboard
